This repository is created in relation to a digital methods class at Aarhus University teached by Adela Sobotkova. 
It contains a portfolio with projects from the class, and also my group's final project with scripts, a licence and the relevant documents. For these, look under the relevat folders. 
My group consists of Sarah Astrup, Laura B. JÃ¸rgensen, Cecilie Hvenegaard Jensen and me, Amanda Mondrup.
